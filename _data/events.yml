    The interest in Kotlin has been growing steadily for the past couple of years, so having done 
    a few talks as part of the Android meetup, we decided to host a separate event dedicated 
    entirely to Kotlin. Luckily for us, the VP of Developer Advocacy at JetBrains is coming to 
    town and we invited him to give a talk. Come along if you’re interested in Kotlin, there 
    will be interesting talks, pizza, beer and some giveaways.

      title: A Deeper Dive into Kotlin
      description: >
        In this talk we're going to dive a bit deeper into some powerful aspects of Kotlin that 
        provide us with great functionality. We're going to cover topics such as delegation, 
        higher-order extension functions, inline and reified functions, and some other features 
        that allow us to create DSL for using in our applications. In addition we'll look at some 
        of the new things coming out in Kotlin 1.1, and in particular Coroutines, Type Aliases,
        Local Delegation Properties and Inline Properties.

      title: Asynchronous Vert.x Applications in Kotlin
      description: >
        Looking at web development, Spring seems to be the star of most Kotlin articles and 
        tutorials. This talk will explore an asynchronous alternative that is Vert.x and evaluate 
        its production readiness. We’ll do that by writing a simple (but working) web API, with 
        some neat Kotlin features to boot, and figure out what the benefits of using this 
        framework are.

      title: "Fantastic DSLs and Where to Find Them"
      description: >
        Kotlin is a very rich language. Unlike many other languages, it allows building another 
        language inside itself. For example, mimic HTML syntax or construct completely typed SQL 
        query. But Kotlin’s power isn’t limited to simple DSLs. With some Kotlin-fu, it’s 
        possible to write a DSL that allows working on untyped data structures in a typed manner.   
        In this talk, we’ll go through different ways to define a DSL in Kotlin, from very simple 
        to fantastically powerful.

      title: "Asynchronous Programming with Kotlin"
      description: >
        Kotlin’s approach to asynchronous programming is about giving developers the freedom to 
        choose what fits best. By leveraging the conventions of the language and its ability to be 
        somewhat extended by using simple functions, Kotlin provides an asynchronous model by 
        implementing coroutines, and provides a series of out of the box functionality such as 
        yield, async/await as part of the standard library. In this session we’re going to see 
        how all of this works and how Kotlin even provides us the ability to implement our own 
        asynchronous functionality.

      title: "You Can Do Better With Kotlin"
      description: >
        This YOW! Night is devoted to the Kotlin programming language. It’s a modern language that gives more 
        power in everyday routines and is gaining popularity amongst the Java developer community.
        <p/>
        Kotlin code generally looks cleaner and nicer, and it’s much easier to work with when you have less 
        verbosity or code duplication. But what’s even more important, is that Kotlin is 100% compatible 
        with all existing Java frameworks, and has good tooling (it’s from JetBrains after all).
        <p/>
        Our agenda for the night consists of three parts:
        <ul>
        <li>Introduction to the language</li>
        <li>Introduction to Kotlin Coroutines</li>
        <li>Practical sides of Java interop</li>
        </ul>
        <p/>
        At first, we'll discuss what makes Kotlin so attractive to developers and cover the most important 
        features of the language. Then, we'll talk about coroutines, a new powerful feature, that changes 
        your habits of writing asynchronous code. The last part is aimed mainly at people who already have 
        some experience with Kotlin and dives into some internals of mixing Java and Kotlin code in one 
        project.

    Welcome back for another meetup! This month we're borrowing Manuel Chakravarty from the Haskell and 
    Swift communities to discuss the benefits of having strong types, and one of our co-organisers, Mitchell

      title: "A Type is Worth a Thousand Tests"
      description: >
        In this talk, I will explain the advantages of a strong commitment to a sophisticated type system. 
        I will illustrate the impact on language and program design through a series of examples, drawn from 
        my experience of developing one of the first Swift-based applications published in the Mac App Store 
        and illustrated by walking through key design issues in a simple iOS app. I will discuss why 
        type-driven design benefits from functional programming principles, and also, how it allows us to 
        write less tests without a loss of confidence in our code.

      title: "Kotlin Backstage"
      description: >
        Kotlin offers a more modern language design over Java, while still being fully interoperable: 
        data classes, properties, delegation, inline functions, string interpolation and much more. 
        But what does all this syntactic surger translate to? In this talk, we will take a look at some of 
        the bytecode that Kotlin generates to support our sweet tooth.

        The Application Continuum is a spectrum of system architecture, showing the evolution of 
        a distributed system starting from a single application and evolving into several applications and 
        services. This tool will help you to make conscious design decisions and potentially reduce the cost 
        of changing code as the system needs to evolve. The continuum is language agnostic and applies to 
        any modern programming language, however, the provided examples will be all in Kotlin. So if you 
        like Kotlin, and enjoy a bit of monolith-vs-microservices discussion, please join us!

      title: "Vaadin on Kotlin"
      description: >
        We will see how we can migrate a Vaadin App from Java to Kotlin. Step by step we will transform the code of an app 
        to see the difference. What are the easy parts, what looks like a little bit more work?

      title: "Kotlin and Bluetooth LE"
      description: >
        Exploring how Kotlin can improve the size, simplicity and maintainability of Android Bluetooth LE code, from reducing 
        boilerplate, simplifying control structures, and using coroutines. Creating a solid Bluetooth LE driver in just a few 
        pages of code.

    It's already been one year since we started Sydney Kotlin User Group, let that sink in! This will be our first anniversary 
    meetup with two great talks, as always, and some reflection on the past events, so think about some feedback that you can 
    contribute.

      title: "Distributed Tracing - Know Your Enemy"
      description: >
        Modern web applications consist of multiple services often deployed on hundreds of different machines. This allows them to 
        be scalable, evolve quickly, deploy often. However, these distributed architectures contain new challenges for debugging. 
        Luckily for us, there is a solution - distributed tracing. In this talk, I'll go through the experience of integrating 
        distributed tracing at Canva, the decisions we made and the challenges we faced.

      title: "Writing Gradle in Kotlin"
      description: >
        This talk covers all you need to know to migrate your Gradle scripts from Groovy to Kotlin. The richer syntax of Kotlin 
        makes your build scripts and utility methods more readable and who really wants to be writing Groovy?

    Last meetup of winter is this month, folks, and it's in a new venue with a new sponsor. Two talks, as usual, one from an 
    organiser and another from an external guest, should be a fun night.

      title: "Data Science and Other Buzzwords"
      description: >
        Kotlin continues to conquer new areas of software development, but some are still firmly held by one or two languages. 
        Data science, statistical analysis and machine learning are largely Python domains, but with many performance-focused 
        implementations based on the JVM, Kotlin has a good chance to break into this scene too. The intention of this talk is
        to give a shallow overview of what you can do today.

      title: "Thinking of Changing Career Direction?"
      description: >
        Are you working with one technology and contemplating the move to another? Or are you considering pivoting into a 
        whole other 'post-technical' career? Are you feeling nervous because it's uncharted territory? This talk might be 
        for you!

    Time for the next meetup and we're back to the host that started it all (even before we were a separate user group) - 
    Atlassian. The two talks cover a broad spectrum, between just starting out with Kotlin and attempting circuit 
    breaking, something for everyone.

      title: "Circuit Breakers with Resilience4J"
      description: >
        This short talk is an introduction to Circuit Breakers. We'll use Resilience4J to add a circuit breaker to an
        example Spring Boot + Kotlin application and then watch its behaviour as errors are encountered.
